## Data Preparation

 - ECG/EMG/EEG data have been already processed in
  
    `Dataset/ECG/processed_data/`
 
    `Dataset/EMG/processed_data/`

    `Dataset/EEG/processed_data/`

## How to run this project
This project contains four main files as follows:

### Step 1: Completing the signals through the proposed methods
`python main_signal.py `
- Here, you can train/validate/test the proposed model.
  - The training procedure is used to record the model under different cases
  - The validation procedure is used to select the proper model structure
  - The testing procedure is used for investigating the coupling effect and the reults can be used to compare with other methods
- Also, you can configure the parameter for different settings.
  - The corresponding files are in  `/Core`

### Step 2: Completing the signals through tensor-based methods
`python main_tensor.py `
- Here, you can complete the missing regions through LATC/LAMC/BTMF/TRMF.
  - The corresponding files are in  `/Baseline`

### Step 3: The prediction results through dl-based methods 
`python main_predictor.py `
- Here, you can predict the missing regions through SAITS/Transformer/BRITS.
  - The corresponding files are in  `/Predictor`

### Step 4: Checking the classification results after completion 
`python main_classifier.py `
- Before run this file, you should finish step 1, step 2, and step 3.
  - The corresponding files are in  `/Classifier`
